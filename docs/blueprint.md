- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif, for a modern and techy feel; body font: 'Inter', sans-serif, for readability and a clean design.
- Use modern, minimalist icons with a thin stroke to convey sophistication and a tech-forward feel. Incorporate Lumion-specific symbols or logos.
- Design a grid-based layout with generous spacing to maintain a clean and structured appearance. Prioritize key elements, such as the coin claim button, with visual emphasis.
- Employ subtle, smooth animations for interactions and transitions to provide a high-quality, fluid user experience. Consider using motion to emphasize the 'farming' concept.
